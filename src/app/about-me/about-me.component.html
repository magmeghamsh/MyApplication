                    Hi..! I'm Meg (pronounced <b>"Megh-amsh"</b>).Nice to meet you, I am a full stack web developer with over
                    5 years of experience in a wide variety of technologies. Currently working as a Software Engineer
                    at <i> <u>Ford Motor Company. </u></i>

                    My work is something I do with lot of honesty, appetite and commitment. Over the past years I had
                    the opportunity to drive and do hands-on work for some amazing companies in United States.
                    I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design
                    problem at a time. I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.
                    I value simple content structure, clean design patterns, and thoughtful interactions.

                    I understand the day to day difficulties in IT World. Here are couple of things am good at<br>
                    <b><i>Organization: </i></b> I believe it’s important to stay organised while working in a team. I keep a track
                    of all the things which are assigned to me.<br>
                     <b><i>Time Lines: </i></b> I value my clients’ time and always aim to work efficiently. Try to finish the work
                    couple of days early before the target date.<br>
                    <b><i>Project Management: </i></b> I think it’s important to identify the discrete stages of a
                    project and work to a schedule around those.<br>
                    <b><i>Documentation: </i></b>Often overlooked, I think it's incredibly important to leave clients with a clear
                    picture of what's been done for the next round of development.
